    <h1>Wham! - Last Christmas</h1>
    <p> Last Christmas
        I gave you my heart
        But the very next day
        You gave it away
        This year
        To save me from tears
        I'll give it to someone special
    </p>
    <p> Last Christmas 
        I gave you my heart 
        But the very next day 
        You gave it away (you gave it away)
        This year 
        To save me from tears 
        I'll give it to someone special (special)
    </p>
    <p> Once bitten and twice shy 
        I keep my distance 
        But you still catch my eye 
        Tell me baby 
        Do you recognize me? 
        Well 
        It's been a year 
        It doesn't surprise me 
    </p>
